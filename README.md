# Civic Twin – AI Powered Governance Digital Twin

Civic Twin is a lightweight agent-based modeling project built using Mesa to simulate societal and governance behavior. It acts as a minimal digital twin where policies, citizen actions, and system responses can be tested safely in a virtual environment. The model allows users to observe ripple effects of decisions, detect emergent patterns, and study governance dynamics. It is designed to be modular, simple, and easily extendable for research or academic use. The goal is to give a foundation for exploring “what-if” scenarios in public systems.

## Features
- Basic agent interactions (citizens, services, governance entities)  
- Policy impact micro-simulations  
- Mesa visualization support  

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
